# youtube-api-project
In this project I used YouTube's API to access their videos, using AJAX and jQuery.

In order to view this project, you will need a YouTube Authorization key.
If you already have one feel free to use that, if you do not, please 
follow the instructions below. If you have an YouTube key already please skip
the instructions below and insert your key inside the JS file where it says, "//Add
your key here."

Instructions for an Authorization Key:

You will need a google account, if you don't have one, you will need to create one.

1. Copy and paste the url link in your browser
https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library?project=youtube-api-project-01&folder&organizationId

2. Scroll down and click on the YouTube API

3. Click the "Create Project" dropdown menu at the top and give a name of your choice and agree to terms and services.

4. Click "Enable"

5. Click "Create Credentials"

6. Leave first dropdown menu as it is (on YouTube API v3), change the second to "Web Browser(JavaScript)", select
"Public Data" and click the blue button.

7.Choose a name, then click "Create API key"

8. You will see the API key you need to make your project work. Make sure you save it in a safe place.

After you have completed these steps go ahead and insert your key into the JS file where it says, "//Add your key here."
